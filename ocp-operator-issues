# If you are unable to see the latest operator after cluster upgrade, please update the catalogsource yaml file.

Example: 
  openshift-logging operator current installed version is 5.3
  latest version is 5.7
  but your web terminal logging version is showing 5.4

Steeps to fix the issues.
  1) Upgrade your cluster to latest version example 4.9 to 4.10 or 4.12
  2) Update the catalogsource yaml file
  3) oc edit catalogsource/<name> -n openshift-marketplace
      spec:
        image: container-proxy.services.eden/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.10
        sourceType: grpc
